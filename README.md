Hello! This is my Movie Recommendation Project, built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and using a MySQL database from Kaggle. It includes a tree structure for data retrieval, a linked list for the wishlist, and a queue for watch history. I plan to add machine learning for better recommendations as I continue developing it.
